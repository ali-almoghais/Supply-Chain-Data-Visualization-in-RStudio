# Supply Chain Data Visualization (RStudio)  

## Overview  
This project analyzes supply chain data using R to identify inefficiencies, optimize supplier performance, and improve logistics operations. It includes **data visualization**, **statistical analysis**, and **interactive dashboards**.

## Dataset  
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Size**: Contains supplier details, shipping times, costs, order volumes, and delivery delays  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Removed duplicate records  
  - Handled missing values in shipping times and costs  

## Tools
- **R** for data analysis  
- **ggplot2** for advanced visualizations  
- **Shiny** for interactive dashboards  
- **dplyr & tidyr** for data manipulation

## Key Insights
- **Shipping Delays**: 25% of shipments experience delays, primarily from Supplier B.  
- **Cost Inefficiencies**: Supplier C has the highest transportation cost per unit.  
- **Regional Trends**: Orders from the East region take longer to deliver due to warehouse congestion.
